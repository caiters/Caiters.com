A little while back I found myself becoming frustrated with my CSS. I was running into specificity issues, having difficulty reusing code, and generally was just unhappy with how things were going. I was spending all of my time just making sure the site looked the way it needed to, and almost no time was dedicated to making sure it wasn't going to bite me later.

It did frequently bite me later.

My first step was to just set a limit on nesting in less and sass, and that definitely helped to some degree, but I would still run into issues every once in a while. While on the search for something better, I learned about BEM CSS.

Honestly, I thought it was horribly ugly. I hated the idea of having two dashes in a row or using underscores in my css. I saw how long some of the class names could be and hated that too. But the people who used it mostly seemed to end up loving it, and it supposedly would solve some of the problems I had been repeatedly running into.

I tried it out on a couple small projects with an extremely low level of confidence that I was doing it correctly. I liked it alright, but it wasn't the small projects that caused me problems.

Then I was handed a pretty sizeable project at work - a redesign of a product microsite that would span roughly 15 pages and involve a lot of reusable components. It was the perfect opportunity to give BEM a shot.

The beginning was rough. I started with the navigation and I must have started over on it at least 3 times. I would start building it one way, then realize that another way would be better or easier to deal with. I also kept second-guessing myself with how BEM should work, particularly with figuring out whether something was actually a block or not (especially when it was inside another block).

notes: can write about how BEM has helped me and then write about the presentation.

Recently at work we started a little thing we're calling the UNICORN (Ultimate Necessary Intelligence Collaboration On Real (k)Nowlege) sessions (we're on a unicorn kick, ok?) where every couple of weeks two of us do a presentation about something, professionally-related or not, to the rest of the company over our lunch hour.

Last week it was my turn! I did a presentation on the [BEM naming convention for CSS](https://caiters.com/bem/#/).

I started learning about BEM late last year. I'd begun to get frustrated
