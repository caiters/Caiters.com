      p.
        This was a really fun project! I got to experiment with fun interactions to add life to the pages (such as the little jobbies peeking from the bottom of the panel when
        you hover over the play button on the main page) and also had the opportunity to experiment with transitions and animation.
      p I have 
        a(href='/blog/2015-12-15-pfister-xtract') a whole blog post 
        | about this site, so I won't go into too much more detail here. Overall though, I had a great time working on it and learned a lot - I tried to do better with performance 
        than I have in the past, got to add some nice transitions based on user interaction, and also got to try out GSAP for the first time.
      p
        small.
          A quick disclaimer: I fully developed the content on About Xtract, Water Pfacts, Installation, and most of Features (less the Innovations panel). Parts of the other pages 
          were pulled from an existing landing page, so not all of the front end dev on those is my own.

        li.project__highlight.
          Animating along a path (at least the one that was in my head) was not super easy with just CSS. GSAP ended up being a much simpler choice. I'm 100% willing to believe that
          I was going about it in the wrong way with CSS so I'll definitely think about it more in the future. But the animation I was coming up with was choppy and unpleasant. 
          GSAP allowed me to do exactly what I wanted to do in a fraction of the time I'd already spent trying out different CSS solutions.
        li.project__highlight.
          With a little bit of planning ahead, it was not challenging to create an IE8-compatible microsite that didn't appear to be missing content without the HTML5 audio.
          We wanted to have all the content accessible even without the audio, so while some of the fun interaction was missing, all of the meat of the page was still available
          without the audio.
        li.project__highlight.
          I learned to be careful what transitions are placed where. I had a transform transition on the same element that was being animated with GSAP (with a transform) and didn't
          realize it at first. I only wanted to animate the transition when the jobbie went out of the glass, which is why the transition was there in the first place. In fact, I 
          didn't realize anything was wrong at all until I realized that some browsers were animating the jobbies differently than Chrome, and Firefox was straight-up crashing after 
          about 30 seconds. The fix ended up just being to put the jobbie inside a container, and the container had the transition which handled the translateY transform.
        li.project__highlight.
          Just because a browser is a modern one does not mean it's going to be just like the others. Test early and test often. Don't get bit by a random bug that only shows up in 
          Firefox again!
