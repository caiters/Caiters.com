It’s been a while since I’ve written here, partly because I feel like anything I might want to say has been said already by people who could say it better! However, I’ve been promising some friends that I would make a list of some of my favorite blogs and websites I use for front-end dev and design resources, and I’ve been slacking off. Since these are the resources I’ve gathered over time, this is finally something I can write that someone else cannot ;)

Hopefully I’ll be able to get back into the swing of things and write here more often. But in the meantime at least, here’s a list of the web dev/design blogs that I try to keep up with.

* [24 Ways](http://24ways.org/) – The best description is right off the front page of the website: “24 ways is the advent calendar for web geeks. Each day throughout December we publish a daily dose of web design and development goodness to bring you all a little Christmas cheer.”
* [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/) – I’m pretty sure that everyone knows about this, but you can’t just leave it out :) really fantastic articles from really smart people.
* [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/) – Lots of neat CSS tricks to be learned here.
* [Finch Fresh Thinking](http://archived.getfinch.com/) – Thought-provoking articles on design
* [Jens Meiert](http://meiert.com/en/) – “Jens O. Meiert (Google, W3C, O’Reilly) on professional web design, web development, accessibility, and usability.”
* [jQuery for Designers](http://jqueryfordesigners.com/) – I’m ashamed to admit it, but I like to just have things work in JS and not have to play with it forever. jQuery makes my life easy for this, so this site is kind of perfect.
* [Just Creative Design](http://justcreativedesign.com/) – Fun to read articles on web and logo design
* Kimili – (link defunct) Pretty sure this is a friend of an old coworker of mine. I’ve enjoyed reading the seldom blog posts though and have used some of the techniques he has written about.
* [Pro Blog Design](http://www.problogdesign.com/blog/) – Many helpful WordPress tips here.
* [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/) – Lots of assorted articles that are generally helpful for web development. They also sell books if you are so inclined to buy some.
* [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) – Yet another site with lots of helpful articles about a wide variety of topics relevant to web designers/devs.
* [Spyre Studios](http://spyrestudios.com/) – Web design/dev magazine. Lots of list type posts (ie “6 amazing things you can do with wordpress”) but I’ve enjoyed reading the articles.
* [The Designer’s Review of Books](http://www.designersreviewofbooks.com/) – I’ve added way too many books (is there such a thing?) to my amazon wishlist because of this site.
* [Vandelay Website Design](http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/) – Nice blog with list posts, inspiration, etc.
* [Web Designer Wall](http://webdesignerwall.com/) – Inspiration for design and development, and tips!
* [Web Designer Depot](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/) – Articles on design and development
* [WP Recipes](http://www.wprecipes.com/) – More WordPress tips and tricks.

People in the web design/development world I like to follow. I think these are all pretty obvious :)

* [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com/journal/)
* [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/)
* [Ethan Marcotte](http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/)
* [Cameron Moll](http://cameronmoll.tumblr.com/)
* [Jason Santa Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com/)
* [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/)

Not updated but I still keep an eye on it and may use old articles for reference:

* Blog Design Blog – (link defunct) Blog on blog design. Surprise!
* Accessites.org – (link defunct) Web accessibility

I think that hits the majority of them. Of course, there are also some sites I don’t follow regularly but still grab some articles off of them that I like. You can always find a [list of the web dev related bookmarks I’ve made on delicious](http://delicious.com/caiters).
