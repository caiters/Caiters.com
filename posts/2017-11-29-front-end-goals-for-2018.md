excerpt: "My personal goals for learning and experimentation with web development, aimed at 2018."

A few years back I tried out an experiment where I theoretically would complete 52 web dev related things in a year. There were a few problems with it, but the biggest is that the size of different projects was widely different and there were some projects that were just not feasible in a given week where I was also expected to work my full time job, be a parent, and sometimes do things that aren't web development.

Sooo needless to say I didn't get that finished!

I'd like to try again with a goal of 2018, but to reduce the scope to something significantly more manageable - preferably tasks that can be done in a single day. A weekend task at the largest, and other tasks taking up an evening after work.

I'm going to give this a start with [52 More Things](/52-more-things/). Wish me luck!
