My coworker Rebecca and I have started [#javascript30](https://javascript30.com/)! I've been interested in learning more vanilla js (at this point I use a lot of frameworks, which I don't think is inherently bad and I have no interest in being elitist about, but I've always wanted to learn how to use the actual base language instead of doing most of my work with jquery). Rebecca started this a couple of days ago, so this morning I woke up early and tackled the first three days of projects.

So far I built a baby drum kit (similar to the piano I built a couple of years ago), a css/js clock, and experimented with css variables and changing them with javascript (which: pretty cool - I never tried css variables before). CSS variables are really intriguing to me because it looks like a great way to change some items on-page without having a lot of inline styles. It would really only be the variable changing, so shouldn't cause any major style conflicts elsewhere.
